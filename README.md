# Food Ordering Application: Rice Runner
https://ricerunner-4cdfa.web.app/
<h2>Modern Food ordering App created with React & Node.js & MongoDB Database</h2>

  The project is a fullstack application to order meals. Design  was created with JavaScript, React library and CSS for styling. To create REST API, Node.js was used along with Express.js framework. Managing the orders was implemented with the use of MongoDB database. 
  The user can add meals to the shopping cart, choosing from menu, remove them and make an order, which is saved in database.
  
  <p>The project is deployed using firebase - frontend part and onrender service - backend part. Unfortunately, as the free version of the services was used, the application takes a long time to load when first launched. </p>
  
<p>For ease of use, a container was implemented using Docker.</p>
<p>Docker-compose contains 3 services: application, server and the database.</p>
